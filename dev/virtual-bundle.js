/*
 * Loads the control bundle for a virtual control, and defines the globals it
 * expects to already be there.
 *
 * A standard control's bundle is loaded with a `<script src>` and needs nothing
 * from the page. A virtual one cannot be: `<platform-library>` compiles React
 * and Fluent *out* of the bundle into references on globals, and those globals
 * have to exist before the bundle's first line runs.
 *
 * **The names are version-encoded, which is why this fetches instead.**
 * `pcf-scripts` maps a declared `<platform-library>` version onto the platform
 * build that supports it, so React 16.14.0 arrives as `Reactv16` and Fluent
 * 9.46.2 as `FluentUIReactv940` — a number that appears nowhere in this
 * repository. Writing those names down here is a trap that springs on the next
 * version bump, with an error naming a global nobody has ever heard of. So the
 * bundle is fetched as text, the names are read out of it, and only then is it
 * evaluated. `dev/smoke.js` does the same thing for the same reason.
 *
 * Everything React sees on this page is a stand-in — see `dev/fluent-stub.js`
 * for the three ways it differs from the real Fluent, and `dev/harness.html`
 * for what the page as a whole is and is not.
